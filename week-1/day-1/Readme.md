## 🤖 What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on building systems that can:

- Learn from data
- Recognize patterns
- Make decisions
- Solve problems intelligently

Examples of AI you already use:
- YouTube / Netflix recommendations
- Voice assistants (Alexa, Siri)
- Face recognition
- Chatbots (like this one 😉)

Behind all of this is **code + data + math** — and Python helps us connect them.
